				<p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Tyler Weir. I am currently a Senior at the 
				University of Puget Sound studying Physics and Computer Science.
				I love to program and tinker with computers. Go checkout my projects on GitHub!
				My favorite language is Python, but I have experience with Java, C, HTML, and CSS.
				I Recently began exploring QML as I try to make a widget for my desktop that 
				shows me my GitHub activity. Over quarantine I began using Linux, and never looked
				back. I love the freedom that comes with having complete control over the
				operating system.  My time in Linux has made me very confident working in the 
				command line.  Somewhere along the way, I was introduced to the vim text editor.
				I've been having a blast practicing vim, and learning to edit text all from the
				home row. 
				</p>

				<p>For fun, I love doing CrossFit, mountain biking, skiing, reading, listening to music 
				and watching movies. Another major interest of mine
			    is creating beautiful aquariums called
				aquascapes.  My most recent aquascape features a Monte Carlo carpet along with
				S. Repens, Crytocoryne Wendtii Green Gecko, Christmas Moss and Rotala 
				Rotundifolia. I am waiting to add fish until there is signiciant plant growth.
				In the mean time, I am feeding the tank with a diy c02 system and large amounts of
				fertilizers. 
				</p>
