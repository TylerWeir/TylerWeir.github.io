		<h1>Resume</h1>
		<p>Here is the contents of my resume</p>

		<h2>Education</h2>
		<h3><u>Undergrad</u></h3>
		<p><strong>Institution:</strong> University of Puget Sound </p>
		<p><strong>Majors:</strong> Physics, Computer Science </p>
		<p><strong>Graduation:</strong> May 2022 </p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>CS Grader</h3>
		<p>I currently work as a grader for two Professors in the University of Puget Sound CS department.
		It is a great opportunity for me to practice reviewing code written by people
		other than myself.  So far it has been a great experience and surprisingly fun.</p>

		<h3>Volunteered at Local Elementry School</h3>
		<p> I volunteered at Fall City Elementry School during STEM week to help the kids with basic 
		programming.  They used a block based language called Snap so they didn't have to worry about 
		the details of syntax.  It was a lot of fun seeing the kids get so excited about Computer Science. 		   </p>

		<h2>Technical Projects</h2>
		<h3>Halo 5 Daily Kill Counter</h3>
		<p>Using a Raspberry Pi computer, I wrote a Python program to download data from the Halo 5 public 		   API and display the total kills performed by a given player on the current day.  The display is 
		made of three 4" seven segment displays. This program taught me alot about programming in the linux 		   environment.  I learned to use tools such as ssh and vim which I still use today.</p>

		<h3>Carry Look Ahead Adder Circuit</h3>
		<p>For my final project in Computer Architecture, I used breadboards to create a 4 bit carry look 		   ahead adder.  This circuit is very similar to the addition hardware in modern computers.  It is 
		much faster than the popular ripple carry adder; however, it requires more complex circuitry.</p>

		<h3>Flocking Algorithm Program</h3>
		<p>I made adaption of Craig Reynolds classic agent based flocking algorithm in Python.  The 
		"boids" or bird objects are represented by small blue triangles that fly around the screen.  They
		perform seemingly complex movement which is driven by three simple behaviors.</p>

		<h3>Verlet Integration Physics Engine</h3>
		<p>Following Jakobsen's Paper, I am in the process of creating a physics engine for rigid bodies 
		defined by sticks and points.  Rather than using Euler's method of integration, the program uses
		Verlet integration: a process by which the velocity of an object is calculated from it's 
		previous positions.  This process is much more stable than Euler's integration routine, thus 
		making it a better match for systems of many interacting rigid bodies.  Currently, I am working on
		the challenge of collision detection between rigid bodies in a system.</p>

		<h2>Affiliations</h2>
		<h3>Physics Club</h3>
		<p>I am a member of the Physics Club hosted by students in the University of Puget Sound Physics
		department.</p>
