		<h2>Education</h2>
		<h3><u>Undergrad</u></h3>
		<p><strong>Institution:</strong> University of Puget Sound </p>
		<p><strong>Majors:</strong> Physics, Computer Science </p>
		<p><strong>Graduation:</strong> May 2022 </p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>CS Grader</h3>
		<p>I currently work as a grader for two Professors in the University of Puget Sound CS department.
		It is a great opportunity for me to practice reviewing code written by people
		other than myself.  So far it has been a great experience and surprisingly fun.</p>

		<h3>Volunteered at Local Elementry School</h3>
		<p> I volunteered at Fall City Elementry School during STEM week to help the kids with basic 
		programming.  They used a block based language called Snap so they didn't have to worry about 
		the details of syntax.  It was a lot of fun seeing the kids get so excited about Computer Science. 		   </p>

		<h2>Technical Projects</h2>
		<h3>Halo 5 Daily Kill Counter</h3>
		<p>Using a Raspberry Pi computer, I wrote a Python program to download data from the Halo 5 public
		API and display the total kills performed by a given player on the current day.  The display is 
		made of three 4" seven segment displays. This program taught me many valuable skills for programming 
		in the linux environment.  I learned to use tools such as ssh and vim which I still use today.</p>
	 

		<h3>Carry Look Ahead Adder Circuit</h3>
		<p>For my final project in Computer Architecture, I used breadboards to create a 4 bit carry look 
		ahead adder.  This circuit is very similar to the addition hardware found in modern computers. 
		It is much faster than the popular ripple carry adder; however, it requires more complex
		circuitry.</p>

		<h3>Flocking Algorithm Program</h3>
		<p>I read Craig Reynolds' paper <em>Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral
		Model</em> which introduced a now classic agent based flocking algorithm. I used this
		algorithm to make a program allowing the user to create small "birds" with the click of the 
		mouse and then watch them flock together. The "boids" or bird objects are represented by small
		blue triangles that fly around the screen.  They perform seemingly complex movement
		which is driven by a couple basic behaviors.</p>

		<h3>Verlet Integration Physics Engine</h3>
		<p>Following Thomas Jakobsen's Paper <em>Advanced Character Physics</em>, I am in the process of 
		creating a physics engine for rigid bodies defined by sticks and points.
		Rather than using Euler's method of integration, the program uses
		Verlet integration: a process by which the velocity of an object is calculated from it's 
		previous positions.  This process is much more stable than Euler's integration routine when working with 
		large quantities of interacting bodies. Currently, I am working on
		the challenge of collision detection between rigid bodies.</p>

		<h2>Affiliations</h2>
		<h3>Physics Club</h3>
		<p>I am a member of the Physics Club hosted by students in the University of Puget Sound Physics
		department.</p>
