		<h2>Education</h2>
		<h3><u>Undergrad</u></h3>
		<p><strong>Institution:</strong> University of Puget Sound </p>
		<p><strong>Majors:</strong> Physics, Computer Science </p>
		<p><strong>Graduation:</strong> May 2022 </p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>CS Grader</h3>
		<p>I currently work as a grader for two Professors in the University of Puget Sound CS department.
		It is a great opportunity for me to practice reviewing code written by people
		other than myself.  So far it has been a great experience and surprisingly fun.</p>

		<h3>Volunteered at Local Elementry School</h3>
		<p> I volunteered at Fall City Elementry School during STEM week to help the kids with basic 
		programming.  They used a block based language called Snap so they didn't have to worry about 
		the details of syntax.  It was a lot of fun seeing the kids get so excited about Computer Science. 		   </p>
